Case - 2: Cluster Management

I tried to implement first two fundamental requiremnets.
    Showing the overview of all cluster for a specific Orgazanization Unit. So I specify the "organizationUnit" and "program" and then used the "trackedEntityInstances" to get all the cluster
    And whe from the "trackedEntityInstances" api used the "trackedEntityInstance" and using this call the "relationships" and the get the contact details related to each of the cluster.
