Case - 2: Cluster Management

Implemented the first two fundamental requiremnets.
    Showing the overview of all cluster for a specific Orgazanization Unit. So I specify the "organizationUnit" and "program" and then used the "trackedEntityInstances" to get all the cluster.
    And then "trackedEntityInstances" api used the "trackedEntityInstance" to call the "relationships" and get the contact details related to each of the cluster.
